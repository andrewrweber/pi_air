# Hosted Service Implementation Guide

## Overview

This directory contains the specification for transforming the Pi Air Monitor from a self-hosted solution to a cloud-hosted service with multi-device support. The implementation is broken down into 5 independent stages that can be developed and tested separately.

## Implementation Stages

### [Stage 1: Database Foundation](01_database_foundation.md)
- **Duration**: 1-2 weeks
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Description**: Set up Supabase backend with database schema, authentication, and security policies
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Supabase project with tables
  - Row Level Security policies
  - Authentication system
  - API key management

### [Stage 2: Device Configuration](02_device_configuration.md)
- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Dependencies**: Stage 1
- **Description**: Implement dual-mode configuration system and device registration
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Extended config.py for cloud mode
  - Setup wizard for device registration
  - API key generation
  - Backward compatibility

### [Stage 3: Data Sync Pipeline](03_data_sync_pipeline.md)
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Dependencies**: Stage 1, 2
- **Description**: Build resilient data synchronization with offline support
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Cloud sync service
  - Offline buffering
  - Automatic recovery
  - Batch upload optimization

### [Stage 4: Authentication & Dashboard](04_authentication_dashboard.md)
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Dependencies**: Stage 1, 2, 3
- **Description**: Extend existing dashboard with authentication and multi-device support
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Login/registration UI
  - Device selector dropdown
  - All devices view
  - Maintained UI consistency

### [Stage 5: Enhanced Features](05_enhanced_features.md)
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Dependencies**: Stage 1-4
- **Description**: Add advanced features for better user experience
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Historical data access
  - Data export (CSV, JSON, Excel)
  - Device management interface
  - Dashboard sharing
  - Notifications and alerts

## Development Approach

### Parallel Development
Some stages can be developed in parallel:
- Stage 2 can start once Stage 1's schema is defined
- Stage 3 can begin after Stage 2's configuration structure is finalized
- UI components (Stage 4) can be prototyped early

### Testing Strategy
Each stage includes specific testing requirements:
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user flows
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure scalability

### Incremental Deployment
- Each stage can be deployed independently
- Feature flags can control functionality
- Gradual rollout to users possible

## Key Design Principles

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Self-hosted mode must continue working unchanged
2. **UI Consistency**: Maintain existing Pi Air Monitor design language
3. **Offline Resilience**: Full functionality during network outages
4. **Zero Data Loss**: Robust buffering and retry mechanisms
5. **Security First**: API keys, RLS policies, and data isolation

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime)
- **Frontend**: Existing HTML/CSS/JavaScript with minimal additions
- **Device**: Python services with SQLite local storage
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with JWT authentication

## Configuration Management

The system uses a unified configuration approach:
- Local `config.json` determines mode (self-hosted vs cloud)
- Cloud settings stored in Supabase
- Device API keys stored securely
- User preferences synchronized

## Migration Path

Existing users can migrate to cloud mode:
1. Run setup wizard
2. Choose cloud mode
3. Register device
4. Optional: Upload historical data
5. Continue with dual operation

## Success Metrics

- Users can manage 10+ devices efficiently
- Dashboard loads in < 2 seconds
- 99.9% uptime for cloud service
- Zero data loss during 7-day outages
- Seamless switching between devices

## Future Enhancements

After core implementation:
- Native mobile apps
- Voice assistant integration
- Machine learning predictions
- Community data sharing
- Advanced analytics

## Getting Started

1. Start with [Stage 1: Database Foundation](01_database_foundation.md)
2. Set up development environment
3. Create Supabase project
4. Follow stage-specific instructions
5. Run tests before proceeding

Each stage is designed to be self-contained with clear inputs, outputs, and success criteria. This modular approach ensures manageable development cycles and reduces risk.
